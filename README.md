There is known bug when you using the HUB MOD:

Current known potential fix, not perfect:
https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunterWorld/comments/f6igrs/psa_potential_fix_for_witcher_missing_geralt_bug/

### There is no perfect fix out there, so I just make this.
### You will get everything normal even the missing Geralt.

## How to use
* No need to remove the HUB MOD.
* Download the MHWSaveTransfer:
   https://github.com/Fusion86/MHWSaveTransfer/releases
  or
   https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/751
1. MHWSaveTransfer: Open Your savefile (SAVEDATA1000), and make a backup for it by click "Save SaveData"!!
2. MHWSaveTransfer: Right click on your char slot that you want to fix, then export as .mhwslot. I will name it "my_buggy_char.mhwslot" here.
3. mhw_witcher_fix: Run and select the "my_buggy_char.mhwslot". It will pop out new window right away when it fixed (in 1 sec.).
4. mhw_witcher_fix: Save the fixed .mhwslot file. I will name it "fixed_char.mhwslot" here.
5. MHWSaveTransfer: Open Your savefile (SAVEDATA1000). Then import the "fixed_char.mhwslot" by click "Import Profiles from another SaveData or .mhwslot file"
6. MHWSaveTransfer: (!!!DO NOT DRAG TO WRONG CHAR SLOT!!!)Drag the right "char slot" data to the left side on the "char slot" you want to overwrite.
7. MHWSaveTransfer: "Save SaveData" and overwrite your MHW save file (SAVEDATA1000).

### * For those who already use the potential fix by CheatEngine on the post of reddit
You will see the blue exclamation mark in Research Base from the lynian expert.
Talk to her, you will get some buggy cutscenes that commander might disapear.
After the cutscenes, you get the cutscenes fixed in the Gallery.

### * For those who did not try any fix yet
You're good to go.
You will see the blue exclamation mark in Research Base from the lynian expert.
